Checked Exception :
i.  Checked exceptions occur at compile time.
ii. The compiler checks a checked exception.
iii.These types of exceptions can be handled at the time of compilation.

vi. Examples of Checked exceptions:
    a) File Not Found Exception
    b) No Such Field Exception
    c) Interrupted Exception
    d) No Such Method Exception
    e) Class Not Found Exception

Unchecked Exception
i.  Unchecked exceptions occur at runtime.
ii. The compiler does not check these types of exceptions.
iii.These types of exceptions cannot be a catch or handle at the time of compilation,
    because they get generated by the mistakes in the program.
iv. They are runtime exceptions and hence are not a part of the Exception class.
v.  Here, the JVM does not require the exception to catch and handle.
vi. Examples of Unchecked Exceptions:
    a) No Such Element Exception
    b) Undeclared Throwable Exception
    c) Empty Stack Exception
